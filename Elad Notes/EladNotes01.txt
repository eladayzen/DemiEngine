  What you have right now:
  - A locally-running tool that lets you configure solitaire playable ads                                                                                                            - A working PixiJS engine with 2-level default config, enter animations, win/fail flow
  - A full config UI with dropdowns, color pickers, toggles
  - Load previous builds, reset to defaults
  - AI gameplay description — type what you want, Claude builds the level layout
  - Generate → Preview → Download as a self-contained HTML ad

  ---
  Natural next things to work on (whenever you're ready):
  - localStorage auto-save — don't lose configs on browser close
  - Export / Import full config — one bundled JSON for sharing/archiving
  - Engine polish — anything that's been bugging you when testing levels
  - Creative description — wire up the "Describe the Creative" block (currently labelled "Future milestone")
  - More game types — the game_type field per level is already in the schema, ready for a second engine
